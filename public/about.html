<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shrinivas R G. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at Reva University and have achieved a CGPA of 8 in my 7th semester. My academic journey has allowed me to develop strong problem-solving skills, and I have a natural ability to think outside the box. I enjoy tackling complex puzzles, and my adaptability helps me navigate various situations with ease. These qualities not only help me excel in my studies but also prepare me for future challenges as I aim to achieve my goals.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I have a deep love for exploration. I enjoy traveling to new places and am particularly passionate about cars and bikes. Discovering new experiences excites me, and in my free time, I enjoy playing games and watching movies. Whether I’m diving into a video game or watching a film, I appreciate the opportunity to unwind and experience different worlds.</p>

<p>My dream is to become an IPS officer, and I thrive on challenges, much like my love for cricket. The sport’s focus on strategy and resilience aligns with my approach to life—I am always ready to take on new tasks and solve problems creatively. With my determination, ability to adjust to situations, and passion for making a difference, I am driven to achieve my aspirations.</p>
